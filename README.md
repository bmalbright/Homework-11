# Homework-11
# Express JS Note Taker

### The assignment was to take starter code given to us and create a notepad style application to write and save notes. The final product would be deployed to Heroku. We were given the front end and created the back end, connecting the two. The back end included a db.json to store and retrieve notes with the fs module. 

## Packages and APIs. 
### We installed Express and Path. 

## Contributions
### Ethan Cho, Chuck Stephens and Mat Lundin helped me with the homework. Several parts were copied from class activities. Also making their way through the zoom rooms were William, Mitchell, Ismeny, Brad, Jayla, and Damien. 

### The application has an MIT license.
